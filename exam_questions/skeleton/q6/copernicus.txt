the neighbours gossiped idly at the door
copernicus lay dying overhead
his little throng of friends with startled eyes
whispered together in that dark house of dreams
from which by one dim crevice in the wall
he used to watch the stars
his book has come
from nuremberg at last but who would dare
to let him see it now
they have altered it
though rome approved in full this preface look
declares that his discoveries are a dream
he has asked a thousand times if it has come
could we tear out those pages
he suspect
what shall be done then
hold it back awhile
that was the priest voice in the room above
he may forget it those last sacraments
may set his mind at rest and bring him peace
then stealing quietly to that upper door
they opened it a little and saw within
the lean white deathbed of copernicus
who made our world a world without an end
there in that narrow room they saw his face
grey seamed with thought lit by a single lamp
they saw those glorious eyes
closing that once had looked beyond the spheres
and seen our ancient firmaments dissolve
into a boundless night
beside him knelt
two women like bowed shadows at his feet
an old physician watched him at his head
the cowled franciscan murmured while the light
shone faintly on the chalice
all grew still
the fragrance of the wine was like faint flowers
the first breath of those far celestial fields
then like a dying soldier that must leave
his last command to others while the fight
is yet uncertain and the victory far
copernicus whispered in a fevered dream
yes it is death but you must hold him back
there in the doorway for a little while
until i know the work is rightly done
use all your weapons doctor i must live
to see and touch one copy of my book
have they not brought it yet
they promised me
it should be here by nightfall
one of you go
and hasten it i can hold back
death till dawn
have they not brought it yet from nuremberg
do not deceive me i must know it safe
printed and safe for other men to use
i could die then my use would be fulfilled
what has delayed them will not some one go
and tell them that my strength is running out
tell them that book would be an angel hand
in mine an easier pillow for my head
a little lantern in the engulfing dark
you see i hid its struggling light so long
under too small a bushel and i fear
it may go out forever in the noon
of life brief day i could not see the need
as now i see it when the night shuts down
i was afraid perhaps it might confuse
the lights that guide us for the souls of men
but now i see three stages in our life
at first we bask contented in our sun
and take what daylight shows us for the truth
then we discover in some midnight grief
how all day long the sunlight blinded us
to depths beyond where all our knowledge dies
that where men shrink and lose their way in doubt
then last as death draws nearer comes a night
in whose majestic shadow men see god
absolute knowledge reconciling all
so all my life i pondered on that scheme
which makes this earth the centre of all worlds
lighted and wheeled around by sun and moon
and that great crystal sphere wherein men thought
myriads of lesser stars were fixed like lamps
each in its place one mighty glittering wheel
revolving round this dark abode of man
night after night with even pace they moved
year after year not altering by one point
their order or their stations those fixed stars
in that revolving firmament the plough
still pointed to the pole fixed in their sphere
how else explain that vast unchanging wheel
how but by thinking all those lesser lights
were huger suns divided from our earth
by so immense a gulf that if they moved
ten thousand leagues an hour among themselves
it would not seem one breadth to our eyes
utterly inconceivable i know
and yet we daily kneel to boundless power
and build our hope on that infinitude
this did not daunt me then indeed i saw
light upon chaos many discordant dreams
began to move in lucid music now
for what could be more baffling than the thought
that those enormous heavens must circle earth
diurnally a journey that would need
swiftness to which the lightning flash would seem
a white slug creeping on the walls of night
while if earth softly on her axle spun
one quiet revolution answered all
it was our moving selves that made the sky
seem to revolve have not all ages seen
a like illusion baffling half mankind
in life thought art men think at every turn
of their own souls the very heavens have moved
light upon chaos light and yet more light
for as i watched the planets venus mars
appeared to wax and wane from month to month
as though they moved now near now far from earth
earth could not be their centre was the sun
their sovran lord then as pythagoras held
was this great earth so so secure
a planet also did it also move
around the sun if this were true my friends
no revolution in this world affairs
not that blind maelstrom where imperial rome
went down into the dark could so engulf
all that we thought we knew we who believed
in our own majesty we who walked with gods
as younger sons on this proud central stage
round which the whole bright firmament revolved
for our especial glory must we creep
like ants upon our midget ball of dust
lost in immensity
i could not take
that darkness lightly i withheld my book
for many a year until i clearly saw
and rome approved me have they not brought it yet
that this tremendous music could not drown
the still supernal music of the soul
or quench the light that shone when christ was born
for who if one lost star could lead the kings
to god own son would shrink from following these
to his eternal throne
this at the least
we know the soul of man can soar through heaven
it is our own wild wings that dwarf the world
to nothingness beneath us let the soul
take courage then if its own thought be true
not all the immensities of little minds
can ever quench its own celestial fire
no this new night was needed that the soul
might conquer its own kingdom and arise
to its full stature so in face of death
i saw that i must speak the truth i knew
have they not brought it what delays my book
i am afraid tell me the truth my friends
at this last hour the church may yet withhold
her sanction not the church but those who think
a little darkness helps her
were this true
they would do well if the poor light we win
confuse or blind us to the light of lights
let all our wisdom perish i affirm
a greater darkness where the one true church
shall after all her agonies of loss
and many an age of doubt perhaps to come
see this processional host of splendours burn
like tapers round her altar
so i speak
not for myself but for the age unborn
i caught the fire from those who went before
the bearers of the torch who could not see
the goal to which they strained i caught their fire
and carried it only a little way beyond
but there are those that wait for it i know
those who will carry it on to victory
i dare not fail them looking back i see
those others fallen with their arms outstretched
dead pointing to the future
far far back
before the egyptians built their pyramids
with those dark funnels pointing to the north
through which the pharaohs from their desert tombs
gaze all night long upon the polar star
some wandering arab crept from death to life
led by the plough across those wastes of pearl
long long ago have they not brought it yet
my book i finished it one summer night
and felt my blood all beating into song
i meant to print those verses in my book
a prelude hinting at that deeper night
which darkens all our knowledge then i thought
the measure moved too lightly
do you recall
those verses elsa they would pass the time
how happy i was the night i wrote that song
then one of those bowed shadows raised her head
and like a mother crooning to her child
murmured the words he wrote so long ago
in old cathay in far cathay
before the western world began
they saw the moving fount of day
eclipsed as by a shadowy fan
they stood upon their chinese wall
they saw his fire to ashes fade
and felt the deeper slumber fall
on domes of pearl and towers of jade
with slim brown hands in araby
they traced upon the desert sand
their rams and scorpions of the sky
and strove and failed to understand
before their footprints were effaced
the shifting sand forgot their rune
their hieroglyphs were all erased
their desert naked to the moon
in bagdad of the purple nights
haroun al raschid built a tower
where sages watched a thousand lights
and read their legends for an hour
the tower is down the caliph dead
their astrolabes are wrecked with rust
orion glitters overhead
aladdin lamp is in the dust
in babylon in babylon
they baked their tablets of the clay
and year by year inscribed thereon
the dark eclipses of their day
they saw the moving finger write
its mene mene on their sun
a mightier shadow cloaks their light
and clay is clay in babylon
a shadow moved towards him from the door
copernicus with a cry upraised his head
the book i can not see it let me feel
the lettering on the cover
it is here
put out the lamp now draw those curtains back
and let me die with starlight on my face
an angel hand in mine yes i can say
my nunc dimittis now light and more light
in that pure realm whose darkness is our peace
