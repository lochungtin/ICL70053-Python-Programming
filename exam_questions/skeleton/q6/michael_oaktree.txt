under an arch of glorious leaves i passed
out of the wood and saw the sickle moon
floating in daylight the pale green sea
it was the quiet hour before the sun
gathers the clouds to prayer and silently
utters his benediction on the waves
that whisper round the death bed of the day
the labourers were returning from the farms
and children danced to meet them from the doors
of cottages there came a pleasant clink
where busy hands laid out the evening meal
from smouldering elms around the village spire
there soared and sank the caw of gathering rooks
the faint flushed clouds were listening to the tale
the sea tells to the sunset with one sigh
the last white wistful sea bird sought for peace
and the last fishing boat stole the bar
and fragrant grasses murmuring a prayer
bowed all together to the holy west
bowed all together thro the golden hush
the breathing hush the solemn scented hush
the holy holy hush of eventide
and in among the ferns that crowned the hill
with waving green and whispers of the wind
a boy and girl carelessly linking hands
into their golden dream drifted away
on that rich afternoon of scent and song
old michael oaktree died it was not much
he wished for but indeed i think he longed
to see the light of summer once again
blossoming the far blue hills i know
he used to like his rough hewn wooden bench
placed in the sun outside the cottage door
where in the listening stillness he could hear
across the waving gilly flowers that crowned
his crumbling garden wall the long low sigh
of supreme peace that whispers to the hills
the sacred consolation of the sea
he did not hope for much he longed to live
until the winter came again he said
but on the last sweet eve of may he died
i wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes
down to the cottage on that afternoon
for i had known old michael oaktree now
so many years so many happy years
when i was little he had carried me
high on his back to see the harvest home
and given me many a ride upon his wagon
among the dusty scents of sun and hay
he showed me how to snare the bulky trout
that lurked under the bank of yonder brook
indeed he taught me many a country craft
for i was apt to learn and as i learnt
i loved the teacher of that homely lore
deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad
influence of the suns and winds and waves
giving my childhood what it hungered for
the rude earth wisdom of the primal man
he had retained his childhood death for him
had no more terror than his bed he walked
with wind and sunlight like a brother glad
of their companionship and mutual aid
we toilers after truth are weaned too soon
from earth dark arms and naked barbarous breast
too soon too soon we leave the golden feast
fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown
of roses from the dreaming brow we pass
our lives in most laborious idleness
for we have lost the meaning of the world
we have gone out into the night too soon
we have mistaken all the means of grace
and over rated our small power to learn
and the years move so swiftly over us
we have so little time to live in worlds
unrealised and unknown realms of joy
we are so old before we learn how vain
our effort was how fruitlessly we cast
our bread upon the waters and how weak
our hearts were but our chance desires how strong
then in the dark our sense of light decays
we can not cry to god as once we cried
lost in the gloom our faith perhaps our love
lies dead with years that never can return
but michael oaktree was a man whose love
had never waned through all his eighty years
his faith was hardly faith he seemed a part
of all that he believed in he had lived
in constant conversation with the sun
the wind the silence and the heart of peace
in absolute communion with the power
that rules all action and all tides of thought
and all the secret courses of the stars
the power that still establishes on earth
desire and worship through the radiant laws
of duty love and beauty for through these
as through three portals of the self same gate
the soul of man attains infinity
and enters into godhead so he gained
on earth a fore taste of nirvana not
the void of eastern dream but the desire
and goal of all of us whether thro lives
innumerable by slow degrees we near
the death divine or from this breaking body
of earthly death we flash at once to god
through simple love and simple faith this man
attained a height above the hope of kings
yet as i softly shut the little gate
and walked across the garden all the scents
of mingling blossom ached like inmost pain
deep in my heart i know not why they seemed
distinct distinct as distant evening bells
tolling over the sea a secret chime
that breaks and breaks and breaks upon the heart
in sorrow rather than in sound a chime
strange as a streak of sunset to the moon
strange as a rose upon a starlit grave
strange as a smile upon a dead man lips
a chime of melancholy mute as death
but strong as love uttered in plangent tones
of honeysuckle jasmine gilly flowers
jonquils and aromatic musky leaves
lilac and lilies to the rose wreathed porch
at last i tapped and entered and was drawn
into the bedroom of the dying man
who lay propped up with pillows quietly
gazing for through his open casement far
beyond the whispers of the gilly flowers
he saw the mellow light of eventide
hallow the west once more and as he gazed
i think i never saw so great a peace
on any human face there was no sound
except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock
the whisper of the garden and far off
the sacred consolation of the sea
his wife sat at his bed side she had passed
her eightieth year her only child was dead
she had been wedded more than sixty years
and she sat gazing with the man she loved
quietly out into that unknown deep
a butterfly floated into the room
and back again pausing awhile to bask
and wink its painted fans on the warm sill
a bird piped in the roses and there came
into the childless mother ears a sound
of happy laughing children far away
then michael oaktree took his wife thin hand
between his big rough hands his eyes grew dark
and as he turned to her and died he spoke
two words of perfect faith and love come soon
o then in all the world there was no sound
except the slumbrous pulsing of a clock
the whisper of the leaves and far away
the infinite compassion of the sea
but as i softly passed out of the porch
and walked across the garden all the scents
of mingling blossoms ached like inmost joy
distinct no more but like one heavenly choir
pealing one mystic music still and strange
as voices of the holy seraphim
one voice of adoration mute as love
stronger than death and pure with wedded tones
of honeysuckle jasmine gilly flowers
jonquils and aromatic musky leaves
lilac and lilies to the garden gate
o then indeed i knew how closely knit
to stars and flowers we are how many means
of grace there are for those that never lose
their sense of membership in this divine
body of god for those that all their days
have walked in quiet communion with the life
that keeps the common secret of the sun
the wind the silence and the heart of man
there is one god one love one everlasting
mystery of incarnation one creative
passion behind the many coloured veil
we have obscured god face with partial truths
the cause of all our sorrow and sin our wars
of force and thought in this unheavened world
yet by the battle of our partial truths
the past against the present and the swift
moment of passing joy against the deep
eternal love ever the weaker truth
falls to the stronger till once more we near
the enfolding splendour of the whole our god
has been too long a partial god we are all
made in his image men and birds and beasts
mountains and clouds and cataracts and suns
with those great beings above our little world
a height beyond for every depth below
those long forgotten princedoms virtues powers
existences that live and move in realms
as far beyond our thought as europe lies
with all its little arts and sciences
beyond the comprehension of the worm
we are all partial images we need
what lies beyond us to complete our souls
therefore our souls are filled with a desire
and love which lead us towards the infinity
of godhead that awaits us each and all
peacefully through the dreaming lanes i went
the sun sank and the birds were hushed the stars
trembled like blossoms in the purple trees
but as i paused upon the whispering hill
the mellow light still lingered in the west
and dark and soft against that rosy depth
a boy and girl stood knee deep in the ferns
dreams of the dead man youth were in my heart
yet i was very glad and as the moon
brightened they kissed and linking hand in hand
down to their lamp lit home drifted away
under an arch of leaves into the gloom
i went along the little woodland road
and through the breathless hedge of hawthorn heard
out of the deepening night the long low sigh
of supreme peace that whispers to the hills
the sacrament and sabbath of the sea
