the snow glows white on the mountain tonight
not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation
and it looks like i'm the queen
the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
couldn't keep it in heaven knows i've tried
don't let them in don't let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal don't feel don't let them know
well now they know
let it go let it go
can't hold it back anymore
let it go let it go
turn away and slam the door
i don't care what they're going to say
let the storm rage on
the cold never bothered me anyway
