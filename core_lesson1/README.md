# Lesson 1 - How to Talk to the Computer

## Ch2 What is programming

- Programming is not only coding
  - Involves three elements
    - **Understanding** and **Formulating** the problem
    - **Designing** an algorithm to solve the problem
    - **Implementing** the algorithm
- Machine code is what the computer understands
  - Writing machine code for humans will be tedious
- Translators convert high-level languages to low-level languages
  - **Compilers** pre-translate codes, then executes
  - **Interpreters** translate and execute code line by line
- Programming languages need to be **unambiguous**
- **Spend more time thinking about the problem and developing a clear algorithm before** coding

## Ch3-5 Designing and improving a guessing game

- While designing an algorithm, we can use
  - **List of steps**
  - **Pseudo-code**
  - **Flow chart**
- Structured program basic building blocks
  - Simple statement
  - Selection
    - `if-else statement`
  - Repetition
    - `while block`
- **Use variables as constants**
  - Easier to maintain
  - Future proof
