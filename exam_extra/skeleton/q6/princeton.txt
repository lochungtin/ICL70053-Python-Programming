here freedom stood by slaughtered friend and foe
and ere the wrath paled or that sunset died
looked through the ages then with eyes aglow
laid them to wait that future side by side
now lamp lit gardens in the blue dusk shine
through dog wood red and white
and round the gray quadrangles line by line
the windows fill with light
where princeton calls to magdalen tower to tower
twin lanthorns of the law
and those cream white magnolia boughs embower
the halls of old nassau
the dark bronze tigers crouch on either side
where red coats used to pass
and round the bird loved house where mercer died
and violets dusk the grass
by stony brook that ran so red of old
but sings of friendship now
to feed the old enemy harvest fifty fold
the green earth takes the plough
through this may night if one great ghost should stray
with deep remembering eyes
where that old meadow of battle smiles away
its blood stained memories
if washington should walk where friend and foe
sleep and forget the past
be sure his unquenched heart would leap to know
their hosts are joined at last
be sure he walks in shadowy buff and blue
where those dim lilacs wave
he bends his head to bless as dreams come true
the promise of that grave
then with a vaster hope than thought can scan
touching his ancient sword
prays for that mightier realm of god in man
hasten thy kingdom lord
land of new hope land of the singing stars
type of the world to be
the vision of a world set free from wars
takes life takes form from thee
where all the jarring nations of this earth
beneath the all blessing sun
bring the new music of mankind to birth
and make the whole world one
and those old comrades rise around him there
old foemen side by side
with eyes like stars upon the brave night air
and young as when they died
to hear your bells o beautiful princeton towers
ring for the world release
they see you piercing like gray swords through flowers
and smile from hearts at peace
