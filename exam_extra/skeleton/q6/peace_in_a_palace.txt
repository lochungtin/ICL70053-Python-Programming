you were weeping in the night said the emperor
weeping in your sleep i am told
it was nothing but a dream said the empress
but her face grew gray and old
you thought you saw our german god defeated
oh no she said i saw no lightnings fall
i dreamed of a whirlpool of green water
where something had gone down that was all
all but the whimper of the sea gulls flying
endlessly round and round
waiting for the faces the faces from the darkness
the dreadful rising faces of the drowned
it was nothing but a dream said the empress
i thought i was walking on the sea
and the foam rushed up in a wild smother
and a crowd of little faces looked at me
they were drowning they were drowning said the empress
and they stretched their feeble arms to the sky
but the worst was they mistook me for their mother
and cried as my children used to cry
nothing but a whimper of the sea gulls flying
endlessly round and round
with the cruel yellow beaks that were waiting for the faces
the little floating faces of the drowned
it was nothing but a dream said the emperor
so why should you weep dear eh
oh i saw the red letters on a life belt
that the green sea washed my way
what were they said the emperor what were they
some of them were hidden said the empress
but i plainly saw the l and the u
in god name stop said the emperor
you told me that it was not true
told me that you dreamed of the sea gulls flying
endlessly round and round
waiting for the faces and the eyes in the faces
the eyes of the children that we drowned
kiss me and forget it said the emperor
dry your tears on the tassel of my sword
i am going to offer peace to my people
and abdicate perhaps as overlord
i shall now take up my cross as count of prussia
which is not a heavy burden you agree
why before the twenty million dead are rotten
there be yachting days again for you and me
cheer up
it would mean a rope for anyone but me
oh take care said the empress they are flying
endlessly round and round
they have finished with the faces the dreadful little faces
the little eyeless faces of the drowned
