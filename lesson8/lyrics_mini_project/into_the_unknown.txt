ah ah oh oh
ah ah oh oh
ah ah oh oh oh oh
i can hear you but i won't
some look for trouble
while others don't
there's a thousand reasons
i should go about my day
and ignore your whispers
which i wish would go away
oh oh oh
ah ah oh oh
oh
ah ah oh oh oh
you're not a voice
you're just ringing in my ear
and if i heard you which i don't
i'm spoken for i fear
everyone i've ever loved is here within these walls
i'm sorry, secret siren but i'm blocking out your calls
i've had my adventure i don't need something new
i'm afraid of what i'm risking if i follow you
into the unknown
into the unknown
into the unknown
