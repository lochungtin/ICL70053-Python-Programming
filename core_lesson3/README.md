# Lesson 3 - Discovering you Paths

## Ch2 Comparison Operators

- **Comparison** operators
  - Greater than `>`
  - Less than `<`
  - Equal to `==`
  - Not equal to `!=`
  - Greater or equal to `>=`
  - Less or equal to `<=`
- **Special cases**
  - `1.1 + 2.2 != 3.3` (floating approximation values)
  - `False < True` (0 < 1)
  - `"10" != 2` (can compare objects of different type, no error)
  - `"B" < "b"` (Capital < lowercase)

## Ch3 If Statements

- **Compound statement**
  - Multiple simple statements inside the statement
- **Indentation**
  - 4 spaces or 1 tab
  - Don't mix them
- **Multi-way selection**
  - `if-elif-else statements`

## Ch6 Function Calls

- Takes some **input**, produces an **output**
- To use a function, we need to know
  - **Name**
  - What it does
  - **Arguments** (inputs)
  - **Return** (output)
- **Importing modules**
  - Keyword `import`

## Ch8 Composition and Abstraction

- **Composition**
  - Using a block of code inside another block
  - To achieve a larger goal
- **Abstraction**
  - Giving block **names**
  - Allow for reusable and self-explanatory code

## Ch9 Incremental Development

- Testing
  - Always test **while** developing
- `pass`
  - Do nothing
  - Use when the inside bits aren't implemented yet
- NO true random
  - **Reproduce experiment results**
    - Making random numbers repeatable with the same seed
  - **Always use a seed number in AI/ML projects**

## Ch10 Commenting

- **Readability**
  - Helps to understand the code
- **Commenting out codes**
  - Temporarily remove code without deleting it
  - Should be removed when complete
- **Multi-line comments aren't actually comments**
  - `''' is a string literal'''`
- Conventions
  - Useful / informative
  - Easy to understand
- **Docstrings**
  - First line of comment is inline with starting `"""`
  - Ending `"""` should be on a line on its own
